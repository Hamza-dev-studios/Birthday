    <p class="message">
        Some people make the world brighter just by being in it…<br><br>
        And you, Usman, make it softer, warmer, and so full of peace.<br><br>
        Your kindness is rare, your heart is gentle, and your presence feels like home.<br><br>
        May this year bring calm mornings, warm nights, and endless moments that make your soul smile.<br><br>
        May every sunrise remind you of your worth,<br>
        and every sunset wrap you in quiet peace.<br><br>
        You deserve a year full of gentle victories,<br>
        soft smiles,<br>
        and love that stays.
